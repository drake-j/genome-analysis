![Limited Family Tree](familytree.png) 


I think it important to explain. My father never has told me the name of his mother or father. I don't plan to disrespect that decision until he has passed. He had a pretty nasty childhood. And on my mothers size, we can only go back the 3 generations because that's when we lose records because that's the generation that immigrated to the states. My family is still pretty fresh off the boat considering I am in MA now and some folks can probably trace back to puritanical times.
